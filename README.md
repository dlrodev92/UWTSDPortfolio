## Introduction
This is a project developed individually to display the my skills and capabilities in web development. Built using React, Tailwind, JavaScript, React Router, and Framer Motion, the project serves as a showcase for past and future projects. The motivation behind developing the portfolio was to demonstrate expertise and attract potential clients or employers.The development process followed Agile principles, emphasizing flexibility.Challenges during development included learning and implementing the Framer Motion library for animations, adhering to best practices in component design, and ensuring reusability and scalability. The project prioritized a clean and intuitive user interface and incorporated responsive design techniques for mobile and tablet devices. Security and performance were addressed by following coding best practices and deploying the project. While no testing or quality assurance processes were conducted yet, future iterations may include such measures. The project considered scalability and future growth, serving as an MVP for an expanded personal website. Documentation was provided for future reference, and key learnings included effective state management and coding practices..
