  "summary": "Mighty Mini Minds is a five-week full-stack web application designed to help children express their emotions through journaling and sharing with their guardians. Developed by a team of six using technologies such as React, Tailwind, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, the project aimed to create a manageable and secure app to promote children's mental health. The team followed Agile principles, including Scrum, to ensure a collaborative and iterative development process. Despite challenges with backend integration and authorization, the team successfully implemented features such as a theme picker, journal, weekly mood tracker, and email sharing. They prioritized security by implementing their own authorization system using JWT and bcrypt for password encryption. Testing was conducted using Jest, and positive feedback from professionals on the field helped shape the final design and features. The project demonstrated scalability and future growth potential, with plans for an expanded version in the future.",
