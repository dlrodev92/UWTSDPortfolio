Built using a technology stack that includes React, Tailwind, JavaScript, YouTube API, and Framer Motion, the project followed Agile methodologies with a strong emphasis on top-notch performance and quick page loading. One of the key challenges was designing the UX, images, and text content from scratch. The website prioritizes user experience and responsive design, with the codebase structured for future scalability. Performance was rigorously tested using Lighthouse, achieving scores above 93 in all metrics, and quality assurance was conducted through ViteTest. The project serves as a testament to the importance of web performance and offers documentation for future development.`,
