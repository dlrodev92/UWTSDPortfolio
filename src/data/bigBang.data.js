    "summary": '"Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" is a frontend app that emulates the popular game from the TV show "The Big Bang Theory." Developed individually using React, Tailwind, JavaScript, and React Router, the project aimed to recreate and enhance an existing project from a bootcamp. The motivation behind the project was to continue learning React and improve upon previous work. The development followed Agile principles, with an emphasis on flexibility, collaboration, and incremental progress. The main challenges involved making the game synchronous, which was addressed by utilizing the useReducer hook instead of useState.The app offers features such as an avatar picker, the actual game, and gameplay. While testing and quality assurance processes were not conducted yet, good coding practices and deploying on the go were considered for security and performance.The project demonstrated responsiveness and scalability, with plans for future expansion.',
